A Python module for getting validated user input via the console which is meant to ease the process of building command line interfaces. Provides the function =ask= which will ask for input until a valid response is given. The =ask= function is similar to and inspired by the function with the same name in the Ruby library [[http://highline.rubyforge.org/][HighLine]].

** Installation

To use cliask you need Python 3. The following describes two ways of installing. The first method requires that =git= is installed and the second does not. Either way the module has to be [[http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html][imported]] for it to be used.

*** pip

Make sure you have =pip= installed then do the following:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
sudo pip install cliask
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Git

=cd= to the directory you want to install in and do
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
git clone https://github.com/Sleft/cliask.git .
#+END_EXAMPLE
to clone the git repository into that directory. You can use the same command if you want to update your installation.
